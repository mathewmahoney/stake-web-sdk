# Lines Games

This is an example of a simple lines-game-win

Wilds have multipliers in the freeGame and have the effect of multiplying a given line win by the addition multiplier of values attached to Wild symbols, 
only when the multiplier value is > 1.

Basegame:
Scatter Symbols appear on all reels, a minimum of 3 Scatters are needed to trigger the Freegame

FreeGame:
A separate reelstrip is used for the freegame 
Wilds have larger multipliers (minimum of 2x) and appear on all reels
2 Scatters are needed to trigger extra spins, appearing only on reels 2,3,4


Notes:
Wilds only pay on 5-Kind. If the paytable is chosen such that 3/4 Kind Wilds pay, the line
calculation will assign the highest base-win symbols as winning. For example if there is a 3-Kind
Wild is on the same line as a 5-Kind L4, the 3-Kind wild will be chosen, regardless of the multiplier
on the final Wild since the base payout 3W > 5L4
